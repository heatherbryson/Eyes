# Eyes
With this assignment we worked a lot with styling and incorporating all three languages to work together. We were given the task of duplicating one of the eyes and making it follow our curser 

## How to Run 
You simply move your curser around the screen and watch as the eyes follow along.

## Future Improvments 
future improvments for this project I'd like to include is changing the image of the eyes as far as shape and colors go. I also think it would be neat to incoroporate a blinking feature.
