# Eyes
With this assignment we worked a lot with styling and incorporating all three languages to work together. We were given the task of duplicating one of the eyes and making it follow our curser. 

To play, simply move your curser around the screen and watch as the eyes follow along.

## How to Run 
Have the HTML, CSS, and Java Script files downloaded and you can run the index.html from your local browser

## Future Improvments 
future improvments for this project I'd like to include is changing the image of the eyes as far as shape and colors go. I also think it would be neat to incoroporate a blinking feature.
